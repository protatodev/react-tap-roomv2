## Specifications

The app will allow welcome the user to the website with a splash screen featuring a basic navigation header. The navigation menu will initially contain two routes: one to view a list of the kegs currently available, and one to add new kegs.

The KegList route will display all currently available kegs. The kegs will be displayed with their appropriate characteristics such as name, brand, price and alcohol content. As an employee, you will be able to sell a pint and view current keg capacity from this screen. Additional employee functionality will be provided for accessibility.

The NewKeg route will allow an admin to create and list a new keg for sale. They will be able to input features such as the keg name, brand, price and alcohol content.
